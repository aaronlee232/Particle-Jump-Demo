# Particle-Jump-Demo
A short 2.5D platformer project aimed to familiarize myself with unity3d's particle and collision systems.

I decided to design this game around the theme of light and dark since I felt like it would fit well with the whole focus of particles.

# Game Overview
## Controls
W - Jump

A - Move Left

D - Move Right

Space - Shoot

## Goal
The goal of this game is to reach the portal at the end of each level to proceed to the next level.

## Checkpoints
Small puddles of Light will turn into a beacon upon contact with the player.

After their transformation, they will serve as a checkpoint in case the player dies. (Note: only one can be active at a time)

Upon contact, they will replenish the player's reserves of light.

## Light
Light is the form of ammo used in this game.

The player will spawn with 3 light, and will expend 1 light after every shot.

## Collectibles
Wisps of light are available throughout the level as a means to replenish light without needing to reach a checkpoint.

Every wisp will only replenish 1 light.

##  Enemies
Anything that is in a shade of purple is a danger to the player.

The mobile purple sphere is capable of instantly killing the player upon contact. Avoid or shoot if possible.

## Hazards
The purple cloud that covers a large area on the ground will deal damage over time, so avoid staying in it for too long

The void below the platforms will also kill the player instantly upon contact, so avoid falling between the gaps in levels.

# Notes
This game only has 2 levels, since I was more focused on designing the mechanics in the game rather than the level itself.

More levels may be added in the future
